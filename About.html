      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is [Your Name], and I am a computer science major student at Avila University. I have a passion for computer building, programming, and I am a huge football and soccer fan.</p>
      <p>I have always been interested in the technology industry and started my journey in web development by myself in junior high with HTML and JavaScript. From there, my interest in programming grew, and I started learning more about automation programming and researching AI.</p>
      <p>I moved to the US about 13 years ago and have been pursuing my passion for programming ever since. I am now a freelancer, working on a variety of projects and collaborating with clients to create dynamic and functional websites.</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me watching football or soccer games, cheering on my favorite teams. I believe that passion is the key to success, and I am dedicated to delivering high-quality work that exceeds my clients' expectations.</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you're interested in working together.</p>
